SI 106 FINAL PROJECT README:
If you run the code you are prompted to insert a client key and then a client secret in order to access Twitter's data. After, you go through Twitter's authorization process and then you are prompted to fill in a valid resource owner key and a valid resource owner secret. Once filling in the proper information, and also providing a hashtag of choice, running the following code retrieves data on the last 200 tweets with that specific hashtag. The code then finds the most frequent word in all 200 tweets and plugs it into the iTunes search API. Following that, a CSV file is written giving information (song name, artist name, song length in seconds, album name, and explicitness) on songs that are related to the most frequent word in the tweets.
Three files are contained in this submission: this README file, a Example csv output image, and the projects ipynb file containing the code.
Python modules that must be installed are: requests_oauthlib, json, webbrowser, requests, csv.
For the code to run properly, run SI106_finalproject.py. You will be prompted to enter a total of 7 items along the way. These items are in order here: Twitter client key, Twitter client secret, Twitter authorization code, Twitter resource owner key, Twitter resource owner secret, a hashtag with the # symbol in front, your same hashtag later on with no # symbol and all lowercase. Run each block and enter information when prompted and the final result will be a csv output as stated above.
CITATIONS AND EXPLANATION:
The code in the first three blocks of code regarding the Twitter API is guided through the lecture 21 notebook from SI 106, as that is a step by step guide on how to create a Twitter API. Certain lines may be direct from the lecture 21 notebook as it was unavoidable in some circumstances. Outside of borrowing certain sections in creating the Twitter API, the rest of the work is my own.
The final result is a csv file that is written giving information (headers being: song name, artist name, song length in seconds, album name, and explicitness) on songs that are related to the most frequent word in the last 200 tweets related to your hashtag.
